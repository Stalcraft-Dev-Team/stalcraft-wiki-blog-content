# New interactive map

Hello everyone!

For six days after the STALCRAFT:X update, our team has been hard at work collecting data and today we are finally ready to announce the release of the new interactive map!

The map site itself was developed about a month ago and now it is part of wikipedia, hence the change in design:

Don't be frightened by such a huge amount of information on the screen. In the near future we will prepare a functionality that will save the selected categories, so you won't have to disable unnecessary labels every time.

## Infection and resource areas

In addition to the usual markers and areas with caches, we have also prepared for you the long-promised infection zones. And in the new north (yes, yes, we prepared it too) you can find mineral and pulp spawning zones, as well as stash locations:

Our goal for the near future is to prepare a video in which we will explain and show where each stash is located and how to sneak to it.

## Suggestion Mode

We decided to keep the suggestion mode. You can turn it on in the menu on the left by pressing the button:

It works as before.

To add a marker, click on the map and in the window that appears select the category, type and description of the marker, then click on the “Add marker” button:

As soon as the marker is verified by a moderator, you will see it on the site.



To delete a marker, click on the tag and in the window that appears specify the reason for deletion, then click on the “Remove marker” button:

The removal request will be reviewed by a moderator and they will give the final verdict.

## Adding areas

If you have found an area that is not on the map, you can point us to it. To do this, select the “Technical” category and the desired type in the Add Label window:

We'll check the location and map the area.

**What about the other maps....**

Please note that at the moment such maps as: Labyrinth, Stillwater and Lyubech-3 are still under development. We will add them to the site when they are ready.

**And the old sites?**

The old domains https://stalcraftmap.net/ and https://stalcraftmap.ru/ will work for some time, after which we will completely abandon them (goodbye, legend).

**Where's the link to the new interactive map????**

And of course, the link to the new interactive map: [https://stalcraft.wiki/en/maps](https://stalcraft.wiki/en/maps)

**You guys are great! Can I thank you in any way?**

If you want to thank us for our hard work, you can send any amount of in-game currency to the following accounts:

**Bupyc** or **Антивирус** - on the Russian server(RU)

**Nister** or **Virus** - on European server(EU)

**Killed** - on NA server

We will be very pleased!

**What if I found a bug or I have a suggestion to improve the map?**

For all bugs and suggestions, write to our Discord: [https://discord.com/invite/yy2yHAa](https://discord.com/invite/yy2yHAa)

That's all! We wish you a successful exploration of the new map :)
