## Website redesign

The appearance of the site has undergone changes: the interface went towards minimalism and became more intuitive, the color palette was saturated with dark tones, the main page was added:

>There are a limited number of articles in English at this time. The reason is that I am not familiar with English-speaking players who write game guides. If you have such a friend, please contact me in Discord: mihanc or via email: stalcraftprojects@gmail.com

## Prolonged lack of updates

As you may have noticed, updates for our resources have become less frequent than before. This is due to the fact that for the last 5 months we have been devoting our free time to the development of a new project, which you will learn about soon.
