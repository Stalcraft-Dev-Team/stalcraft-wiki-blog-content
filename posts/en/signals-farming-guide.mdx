This article is intended to help players with the search for data beacons for craft of Buryat Short Range Detector or paint cases, this strategy has been personally tested by me many times and in confirmation of my words I will publish at the very bottom of my statistics on the signals.

## Data beacon "Alpha"
There are 7 locations to farm Alpha Beacons: Swamp, Cordon, Agropolis, Dark Valley, Dump, the Pit and the Forest. The most convenient locations for farming Alpha are all except the Forest. The reason for this is explained below.

Routes to farm Alpha beacons are listed below for bandits:![routes to farm alpha beacons for bandits:](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/alpha-banditi-marshrut.jpg)

Routes to farm Alpha beacons are provided below for stalkers:![routes to farm alpha beacons for stalkers-1:](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/alpha-marshrut-stalkeri-1.jpg)

### Description of locations

**Swamp** - I do not consider this location due to the low spawn rate and the size of this location, moreover it is inconvenient to move, the loot is very and very little, as well as details, so I advise you to start your way from Cordon and above, or from the Bar and below.

The **Cordon** is a convenient location, there are no obstacles to move around, and there is a place in the middle of the location to recharge the wide and narrow range detectors. This point is here:

**Dump** is the second convenient, but also somewhat inconvenient location. It is convenient because it has a safe zone where you can also charge the SAK and ROV - at the diggers' base, and it is inconvenient because there is an anomalous crevice with a lot of blackholes. Also, the signals like to spawn in the blackholes:

![spavn signals in the funnels at the location dump](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/alpha-svalka-voronki.png)
Otherwise, the location is quite pleasant and convenient for farming Alpha.

**Dark Valley and Agroprom are two good locations, due to the small size of these two locations even the SAK-1 takes up most of the area and you don't have to walk the entire width of the location to get a signal.

The **Pit** is also a convenient location, but everything is a bit spoiled by the swamps, so sometimes you have to swim for signals. This is not such a small disadvantage compared to the forest.

**The forest is the worst place in the game to farm alpha beacons. All because of that cesspool:
![выгребная яма с термозаражением на локации Лес](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/alpha-les-vigribnaya-yama.png)

This location splits the signal search in two and often you will have this situation:
![no signal found at the Forest location](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/alpha-les-signal-not-found.png)

### Tips for farming these locations

- Master servers in the evening or at night are very generous with signals, you can farm from 9 to 40 signals in one run without much trouble.
- To farm a large number of Alpha beacons, it is recommended that you make several SAK-1, two or three at a time. One SAK-1 is given for free in the first part of the story quests.
- Reset scanning is recommended at 6 light bulbs.
- Assembling for speed, though the simplest, will help you loot a large number of signals in a short period of time.
- The brighter the light bulb SAK-1 shines, the more signals there are around you.

Example of the brightness of the light bulb when there are about 3 or more signals near you:

## Data beacon Beta
There are currently only two locations for farming Beta group beacons, Dead City and Graveyard.

### Dead City

Dead City can be divided into two parts. The main signal spavn is located in these points:
![beta beacon spawn points at the Dead City location](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/beta-mertviy-gorod.png)

They can spawn in other zones as well. But often it is here. Before you farm the Beta, it is recommended that you place 3 stashes all over the place, at these points:
![locations for hiding places at the Dead City location](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/beta-mertviy-gorod-2.png)

To scan two zones simultaneously, it is recommended to use these positions:![positions for scanning two signals simultaneously](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/beta-mertviy-gorod-3.png)

### **Graveyard**

There are only 4 main signal scan zones at this location:
![scanning areas at the Graveyard location](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/beta-mogilnik.png)

The Graveyard is the smallest location and SAK-1 is able to scan all 4 locations at the same time. Just like in the Dead City, I recommend placing 3 caches around the location:
![places to set up caches on the location Graveyard](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/beta-mogilnik-2.png)

And the most important hint - the number of signals in the Graveyard regardless of the online and spawn once in about 4 minutes stable. Just like with Alpha, I recommend building for speed and reset scanning to 6 bulbs, because the search for signals depends entirely on the speed of your actions.

Hints:
- Dead City and Graveyard are the hardest locations to farm beacons, even night and masterful servers don't guarantee you calm farming, so it's as luck here.
- These two locations strictly require schematics on them, for complete convenience I highly recommend not putting data fragments, as they weigh a lot. I recommend putting items with low weight there: beacon, dust, blueprints, artifacts.
- At these locations there is a huge competition, the principle of search: who is faster - and the signal belongs to him.

## Data beacon Gamma
The most elementary beacon in the search, and also one of the most profitable, for spavn signals high, and loot in them is very and very tasty.

### The Way of the Fools

### Army Depot

![Gamma beacon spawning zones at the Army Depots location](https://stalcraftwiki-prod.b-cdn.net/blog/ru/aktualnoe-rukovodstvo-po-farmu-signalov/gamma-arm-skladi.png)

As I mentioned above, this is the most basic beacon, so the recommendations are as follows:
- Take out through the official grouping base (WARNING! Lots of scammers).
- Use the speed build
- Signals can be searched for under the mercenaries/debt base
- Use caches or not - at your discretion.

## Data beacon Digamma
I will not advise how to farm for Digamma for players without a clan, because it is impractical and useless in view of the existence of clan. Guide here is only one - to look for signals can play from the base of the clan, went out of the base, check if there is a signal, if yes - look for, if not - you can change the copy of the location through the same base of the clan. Lost the signal, put it in the base and so repeat until the SAK is not discharged. A SAK-1 will be enough here.

There is also a place for Backwater, but it is very dangerous, but you can try to go to Backwater, scan the signal, pick it up and immediately run out of Backwater.

## Addendum to the main guide

When searching for signals, if SAK-1 captures two signals at the same time, one of which is a quest signal and the other is a normal signal, then no matter how close the normal signal is to you, the **quest** signal will be scanned first, and then the normal signal. An example of such a signal would be your first quest signal on Kaa, and a second example would be the northern signal on the daily serum quest. The second one has a bit of a catch.

## Northern Signal - Find and kill Art Hunters

There are times when you go to an Art Hunters scan point and there is no signal - it happens and you should not despair. Sometimes you can find Art Hunters two times in a row on the same point, and it happens that on the marked radius they are not there at all. For this, it is advised to go to other points and look for Art Hunters there. Arthunters are also a priority signal, so if you find a regular signal in the Arthunters signal search area, there is no Arthunters signal there.

Also note that if two players have a quest to find and kill Arthunters - the quest will be counted only to the one who found Arthunters, the second cohort or random player will not be counted **will not**.

## Conclusion

I consider signaling to be the best activity in the game, as it is not only the most methodical, but also the most profitable in terms of cost. This guide is how I personally searched for signals and found quite a number of them:
